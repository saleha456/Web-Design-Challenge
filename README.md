# Web-Design-Challenge

This project was to create a website to display information about latitude data and compare it to various types of weather data such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. 

**Website link:** https://saleha456.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/

The website was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (for navbar). It includes a homepage, 4 data visualizations pages, a comparison page to compare the images, and a data page with a table.  All pages are responsive.  Each visualization page has a border around the image to indicate what the active page is.
